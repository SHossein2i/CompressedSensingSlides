# CompressedSensingSlides
Slides of my lectures on compressed sensing at SUT (PDF format)
Lectures contains the basics of compressed sensing theory including random and deterministic measurements, practical implementations, optimization of measurements, sparsifying basis, sparse reconstruction and recovery algorithms for srtuctured sparsity, and some applications in adaptive identification, telemonitoring of biomedical signals, and neighbour discovery in wireless networks.
